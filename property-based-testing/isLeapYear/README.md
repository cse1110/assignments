The `isLeapYear` method returns whether a year is a leap year or not. Leap years are either (i) multiples of 400, or (ii) are multiples of 4 but not multiples of 100. The implementation is quite straightforward. 

Your task is to write property-based tests (usinq JQWik) for this `isLeapYear` method.

Some tips:

* A good property-based test for this problem ensures 100% branch + condition coverage.
* Have the JQWik manual at hand: https://jqwik.net/docs/current/user-guide.html (right-click and open in a new tab)
