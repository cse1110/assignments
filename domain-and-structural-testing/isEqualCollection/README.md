Automate the test cases you devised. Write them as JUnit5 test cases.
If necessary, you can also test the helper methods directly.

You should:

- Link your test code with the test cases you created in the previous exercise. Adding comments (e.g., // test case 1) is a good solution.
- Write beautiful test code. Make sure you have no duplicated code in your tests.
