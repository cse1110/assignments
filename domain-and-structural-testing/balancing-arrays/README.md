Given a non-empty array **of non-negative numbers**, return true if there is a place to split the array so that the sum of the numbers on one side is equal to the sum of the numbers on the other side.

**This does not work for negative numbers, you can skip those tests.**

Use domain testing and derive tests for the `canBalance` method. Then, augment your test suite with structural testing and reach achieve 100% branch+condition coverage.
