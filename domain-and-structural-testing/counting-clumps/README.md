See the implementation of the following problem: A "clump" in an array is a series of 2 or more adjacent elements of the same value. Return the number of clumps in the given array.

Use domain testing and derive tests for the `countClumps` method. Then, augment your test suite with structural testing and reach achieve 100% branch+condition coverage.
